# quickstart-provectus-streaming-data-platform
## Streaming Data Platform on AWS

This Quick Start automatically deploys Provectus Streaming Data Platform in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. This Quick Start is for users who are interested in enabling real-time analytics and want to explore capabilities of a streaming-first data platform.

Streaming Data Platform enables real-time data analytics and serves as a foundational service for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Provectus’s streaming-first architecture powers and provides governance for a data lake ecosystem. This solution consolidates data pipelines and improves scalability in the cloud for real-time analysis.

This Quick Start deployment includes Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics and Amazon Athena, which aren’t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see [Service Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html).

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy Streaming Data Platform in your AWS account in about 20 minutes.
